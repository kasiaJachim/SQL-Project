Code First Girls Data and SQL Final ProjectðŸ™Œ
I took Code First Girls' Data and SQL course during winter 2022/2023. This 8-week course covered:


SQL programming language
Database management
Data analysis and manipulation
Visualising data
This repository contains the final project that I presented at the end of the course. It is a database to keep track and manage a caravan parks club. My project contains the code used to create the database and tables.![ER Diagram](https://github.com/kasiaJachim/SQL-Project/assets/119347548/8f379e6b-74c4-438b-a7a0-7dea4ee08b1d)
